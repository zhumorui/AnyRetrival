# AnyRetrival: Enhancing Zero-shot Image Retrieval with Vision Foundation Models


This repository evaluates the performance of DINOv2 models on image retrieval tasks using the ROxford5k and RParis6k datasets. DINOv2 models leverage self-supervised learning to extract robust and generalizable features without relying on labeled data. The results show that DINOv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in various retrieval scenarios, particularly excelling in high-quality and moderate-difficulty tasks. By supporting flexible input resolutions (224x224 and 448x448) and scalable model sizes (from vits14 to vitg14), DINOv2 adapts effectively to diverse use cases, offering a balance between computational efficiency and retrieval accuracy. Notably, DINOv2 surpasses traditional supervised models like DELG in easy scenarios while demonstrating competitive performance in hard retrieval challenges.
